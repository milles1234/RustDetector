so i am using uv to manage the backend here -- if you want to run this backend server then all you need to do is get
## - powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

run this command from the powershell then run close it

cd here to this rustdetector/backend then -- do this in terminal
# uv sync

that all then its going to manage all the dependecy that we have here
